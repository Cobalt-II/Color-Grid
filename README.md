# Color-Grid
A simple puzzle game that involves completing a grid based on a simple set of rules.

Rules: 
The game is played on a 3x3 grid. There are 6 colors (red orange yellow green blue purple). You can click on grid tiles to change the color. The goal is to get a grid which follows the rules. You'll initially be given 4 starting grid tiles, which are paler versions of the regular grid colors (but still act like the regular ones) to indicate that they are given. The other tiles will have to be clicked on by the player to be edited. The goal is that for each row and column, there must be no two same colors and no two colors that are opposites on the color spectrum (red-green, orange-blue, yellow-purple).
